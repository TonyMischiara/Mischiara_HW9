## ✅ Best Practices Implemented

### 📋 Form Design & Structure
This form follows core principles of good UX for web forms:
- **Required Field Validators**: Critical inputs are required to prevent incomplete submissions.
- **Autofocus**: The cursor is automatically placed in the first input field to guide users.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Icons are used to enhance usability and visual cues.
- **Tooltip Help**: A tooltip is available to explain form inputs for clarity without clutter.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Pages are broken into logical steps to reduce user fatigue.

Each page of the site uses semantic HTML5 elements (`<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<button>`) to organize content, which improves both structure and accessibility.

### 💅 Styling with Bootstrap
- Bootstrap 5.3 was used to ensure mobile-first responsive layout.
- Consistent margins, paddings, and color schemes were applied using Bootstrap utility classes.
- The layout adapts fluidly to both mobile and desktop environments.

## ♿ Accessibility

This web form was built with accessibility in mind:
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance verified using WAVE and W3C validators.
- Proper use of labels associated with form inputs (`<label for="id">`) for screen readers.
- Tooltips and icons include `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` attributes where necessary.
- Sufficient color contrast was maintained for all text and backgrounds.
- The layout is fully keyboard-navigable and responsive on screen readers.

These efforts ensure the form is usable by individuals with vision impairments or limited mobility.
